# WorkAI-A-Toolkit-for-the-Design-of-AI-driven-Future-of-Work
This repository contains the WorkAI Toolkit, which includes a deck of 20 cards and a two-sided canvas. The cards are in DIN A5 format, with content on both sides. The canvas is DIN A3 size, with the front side focused on the first stage of the design process—"Imagine"—and the back side reserved for documentation and notes.
